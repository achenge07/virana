**The Virus Analysis Toolkit**

Virana, the virus analysis toolkit, is a Python-based software toolkit for analyzing metatranscriptomic (and, to a degree, metagenomic) sequence data in a context of clinical metagenomics in order to:

    - identify pathogen nucleotide sequences in transcriptomic (and, while less tested, genomic) short read data
    - identify pathogen transcripts diverged from known references of various microbial species
    - identify transcripts expressed at low abundances across multiple samples
    - identify transcripts homologous to human factors such as certain viral oncogenes

A recent analysis of human tumor transcriptomes displays the ability of Virana to detect diverged viral nucleotide sequences and human-viral homologs with high sensitivity.
